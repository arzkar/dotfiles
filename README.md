A repo containing my dotfiles. I use it to sync them between my computers using [stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/)

# Installation

The install.sh expects the DE as the args, currently supported are i3 & kde

Run at your own risk:

```
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arzkar/dotfiles/main/install.sh | bash -s i3
```
